# `pi-from-rand`

`pi-from-rand` is a piece of software that calculates pi from generating pairs of random numbers and checking if they are co-prime or not. This idea comes from Matt Parker's video [Generating Ï€ from 1,000 random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU).

Usage:

`python pi.py --pairs PAIRS --max MAX`, where `PAIRS` are the number of times to roll a pair of numbers, and `MAX` is the maximum number it is possible to roll.
